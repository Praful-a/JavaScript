* CODING CHALLENGE 3

/*
John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and $268.
To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.
In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
1) Containing all three tips (one for each bill)
2) Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).
(NOTE: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it with 20/100 = 0.2)
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

function tipCalculator(bill) {
    var percentage;
    if (bill < 50) {
      percentage = .2;
    } else if (bill >=50 && bill < 200) {
      percentage = .15;
    } else {
      percentage = .1;
    }
    return percentage * bill;
}

var bills = [124, 48, 268];
var tips = [tipCalculator(bills[0]),
            tipCalculator(bills[1]),
            tipCalculator(bills[2])];
var finalValuse = [bills[0] + tips[0],
                   bills[1] + tips[1],
                   bills[2] + tips[2],]
console.log(tips, finalValuse);
